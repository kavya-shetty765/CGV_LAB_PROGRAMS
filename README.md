<h2>CGV-LAB_PROGRAMS</h2><br>
<h4>1.Implement Brenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithm for all types of slope.</h4><br>
<h4>2.Create and rotate a triangle about the origin and a fixed point.</h4><br>
<h4>3.Draw a colour cube and spin it using OpenGL transformation matrices.</h4><br>
<h4>4.Draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera suitably to experiment with perspective viewing.</h4><br>
<h4>5.Clip lines using Cohen-Sutherland algorithm</h4><br>
<h4>6.To draw a simple shaded scene consisting of a tea pot on a table. Define suitably the position and properties of the light source along with the properties of the surfaces of the solid object used in the scene.</h4><br>
<h4>7.Design, develop and implement recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to form 3D Sierpinski Gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user.</h4><br>
<h4>8.Develop a menu driven program to animate a flag using Bezier Curve algorithm</h4><br>
<h4>9.Develop a menu driven program to fill the polygon using scan line algorithm</h4><br>
